# Changelog

All notable changes to pi-link are documented here.

This changelog is based on the git history from `2026-03-21` (initial commit) through the present. Versions correspond to npm publishes.

---

## 0.1.16 — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **`link_compact` tool — ask another terminal to compact its context window and wait until it finishes.** A fourth LLM tool alongside `link_send`, `link_prompt`, and `link_list`. The call blocks until the target reports compaction complete, so an orchestrator can immediately dispatch follow-up work to a freshly trimmed worker without sleeping or polling. Busy targets (mid-turn or already compacting) decline instead of being interrupted; self-targets are rejected with a pointer to `/compact`; unknown targets resolve immediately as `not_found`; the call times out after 180 seconds. Compact several workers at once via parallel tool calls. Adds `compact_request` / `compact_response` wire messages, both hub-forwarded with an authoritative `from`.

### Changed

- **`/link-name` now collapses internal whitespace.** Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped, and runs of internal whitespace collapse to a single space. `/link-name "build   lead"` saves and shows as `build lead`. Startup names (`--link-name`), saved-name load, saved-name comparison, and the `/link-name` command all normalize identically via a shared `normalizeName()` helper — so a saved name with stray spaces compares equal to its trimmed/collapsed form and won't trigger a redundant append on resume.

### Fixed

- **Hub no longer broadcasts spurious `terminal_left` for already-removed clients.** The hub's WebSocket close handler now looks up the client in live hub state instead of a closure variable captured at register time. If the socket has no live entry — a duplicate or post-removal close event (e.g. a close firing after the error handler's own `close()`) — it's ignored. Previously this could produce phantom "X left" notifications and drift `connectedTerminals` between hub and clients.

### Internal

- **Behavior-identical refactors.** Shared helpers (`targetNotFound`, `renderIconResult`, `latestCustomData`) extracted to remove duplication across tool execute/render paths and session-entry scans. `pushStatus()` skips the `captureContext()` call on no-op pushes. `CompactResponseMsg.reason` comment updated to include `"unsupported"`. No user-visible behavior change.

---

## 0.1.15 — 2026-05-18

Stable release for the 0.1.15 cycle, promoted after beta soak.

### Install note for Pi 0.75+

Pi 0.75 installs Pi packages under `~/.pi/agent/npm/`, so `pi install npm:pi-link` still enables the in-Pi extension features (`/link*`, tools, `--link`) but no longer puts the `pi-link` shell launcher on PATH.

If you use `pi-link <name>` from your shell, also install the launcher globally:

```sh
npm i -g pi-link
```

Users who only use pi-link inside Pi do not need this extra step. Background: [pi-mono#4587](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/4587).

### Breaking

- **Pi 0.74+ is now required.** pi-link now uses the `@earendil-works/*` Pi package namespace. Users on Pi ≤0.73 should pin `pi-link@0.1.14`.

### Added

- **`--list` and `--resolve <name>` flag forms for the `pi-link` CLI wrapper.** Use instead of the `list` / `resolve` subcommands. `--resolve=<name>` joined form also accepted. This fixes the reserved-word collision that prevented sessions named `list` or `resolve`, and the silent-typo failure mode where `pi-link resolv foo` would create a session called `resolv` and pass `foo` as a prompt to Pi.

  ```
  pi-link --list [--global|-g]
  pi-link --resolve <name> [--global|-g]
  pi-link --resolve=<name>
  ```

### Changed

- **Removed Pi peer dependencies from `package.json`.** Pi provides its own extension APIs at load time; declaring them as npm peers caused unnecessary install warnings and duplicate package installs. `ws` remains the only runtime dependency.
- **`pi-link --resolve <missing-name>` now exits with code `2`** (was `0`). Single match still exits `0`; ambiguous still exits `1`; not found is now distinguishable from success in scripts. The legacy `pi-link resolve <missing-name>` form gets the same fix.
- **`pi-link <name> <extra-positional>` now errors** instead of silently passing the extra to Pi as a prompt. Catches typos like `pi-link resolv foo`. Tokens that follow a flag without `=` are still accepted as that flag's value (e.g. `pi-link worker --model opus` works). Use `--` to pass bare positionals through unchanged: `pi-link worker -- some-arg`.
- **`pi-link foo --help` now errors** with "cannot combine session name and --help" instead of silently passing `--help` to Pi. Run `pi --help` for Pi's own help.
- **Published tarball trimmed to 7 files.** Explicit `files` allowlist so internal planning artifacts and the test harness no longer ship to npm.

### Deprecated

- **`pi-link list` and `pi-link resolve` subcommands.** Use `--list` / `--resolve` instead. Subcommands still work for one release with a stderr deprecation warning, then will be removed.

### Migration from 0.1.14

Existing launcher aliases keep working for this release, but deprecated `list` / `resolve` subcommands now print a stderr warning.

One behavior change may affect scripts: `pi-link resolve <missing>` now exits `2` instead of `0`, so callers that trusted exit `0` to mean "found" should update their handling.

To silence the deprecation warning, switch to the flag form:

| Old                            | New                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pi-link list`                 | `pi-link --list`                                                   |
| `pi-link list -g`              | `pi-link --list -g`                                                |
| `pi-link resolve foo`          | `pi-link --resolve foo`                                            |
| `pi-link resolve foo -g`       | `pi-link --resolve foo -g`                                         |
| `pi-link resolve --global foo` | `pi-link --resolve foo --global` (order matters in canonical form) |

---

## 0.1.15-beta.0 — 2026-05-17 _(pulled — do not install)_

Initial 0.1.15 beta, superseded by `0.1.15`.

**Issue:** peer dependencies still pointed at the old `@mariozechner/*` namespace, causing npm to install deprecated Pi 0.73 packages on Pi 0.74+ systems.

**Resolution:** stable `0.1.15` uses the `@earendil-works/*` runtime imports and removes Pi npm peer dependencies.

---

## 0.1.14 — 2026-05-04

### Added

- **`--link-name <name>` flag for link-only startup naming.** Run `pi --link-name worker` to join the link as `worker` while leaving Pi's normal session selection/resume behavior untouched. This restores link-name startup naming in a cleaner form than the previous session-coupled implementation: it sets only the pi-link identity, with hub collision handling unchanged. Use `pi-link <name>` when you want the combined session-by-name + link-name workflow. Empty or whitespace-only `--link-name` values are rejected with a clear error. The `pi-link` wrapper itself does not accept `--link-name` — its rejection message now points to either `pi-link <name>` (combined) or `pi --link-name <name>` (direct, link-only).

### Changed

- **`link-name` session entries no longer accumulate on no-op restarts.** Both `pi-link <name>` and `pi --link-name <name>` skip the append when the saved name already matches. Sessions opened and exited without any persisted activity will no longer bump `pi-link list` recency from the same-name startup alone; recency still updates on messages, tool calls, edits, and real link-name changes.

---

## 0.1.13 — 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- **`pi-link resolve <name>` now rejects whitespace-only names.** Previously a name that normalized to empty (e.g. `pi-link resolve "   "`) fell through to session lookup and silently reported no match. The empty-name check that already covered `pi-link <name>` now also runs in `resolve`, printing usage and exiting non-zero.
- **README wording: session-dir lookup phrasing tightened** to say "matches Pi's lookup order" instead of "mirrors Pi's".

---

## 0.1.12 — 2026-05-03

### Changed

- **TypeBox import migrated from `@sinclair/typebox` to `typebox`.** Pi 0.69.0 migrated to typebox 1.x's bare-package name; `@sinclair/typebox` still resolves to the same module via Pi's legacy alias, so behavior is unchanged for our root `Type.*` imports. Aligns with Pi's preferred naming and avoids future churn if the alias is dropped. README's "Provided by Pi" table updated to match.

### Fixed

- **`pi-link list/resolve/<name>` now respect Pi's session-dir configuration.** The CLI hardcoded `~/.pi/agent/sessions` and ignored Pi's actual lookup chain, so users with a custom session location saw "no sessions" from `list`/`resolve` and — worse — `pi-link <name>` silently started a new session instead of resuming the existing one, fragmenting history into orphans across the real session dir. Resolution now matches Pi's lookup order (minus `--session-dir`, which the CLI rejects): `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` → `<cwd>/.pi/settings.json` `sessionDir` → `<agentDir>/settings.json` `sessionDir` → default `<agentDir>/sessions/<encoded-cwd>`. `<agentDir>` follows `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`. Tilde expansion (`~`, `~/...`) matches Pi's `expandTildePath`. Custom layouts are scanned flat; default keeps the encoded-cwd subdirs. Malformed `settings.json` warns to stderr and falls through. Empty env vars and empty/non-string `sessionDir` values are treated as absent.
- **`pi-link <name>` now rejects Pi-managed flags even when passed as the first token.** Previously `pi-link --link-name foo` or `pi-link --session path` silently treated the flag as a session name. The validation that already covered later flags now also runs on the first token, with the same error messages.
- **`pi-link <name>` and `pi-link resolve <name>` now scope name lookup to the current cwd by default; `--global` / `-g` widens to any cwd.** Previously both commands scanned every session everywhere, so `pi-link work` from `~/projects/A` would silently resume `~/projects/B`'s `work` session if no local match existed — mixing one cwd's files into another cwd's session history. By default only current-cwd matches are considered; `--global` restores cross-cwd lookup, with duplicate exact names still failing with candidates. When `pi-link <name>` finds no local match but matches exist elsewhere, it warns and points at `--global` instead of silently jumping. `--global` may be passed before or after the name. `pi-link resolve` now also rejects extra positional arguments and unknown flags. **Breaking change**: `pi-link list --all` is renamed to `pi-link list --global` (`-a` → `-g`) for consistency across the three commands. As a transition aid, `--all` / `-a` are explicitly rejected with a pointer to the new flag name (mirroring the `--link-name was removed` treatment) so users with muscle memory get a clear hint instead of a generic "Unknown argument".
- **Hub now uses its authoritative socket→name mapping when forwarding chat/prompt messages.** Previously the hub forwarded `chat`, `prompt_request`, and `prompt_response` with whatever `from` the client claimed, while normalizing `status_update` against its socket→name mapping. The asymmetry meant a client with a stale or optimistic local `terminalName` could leak the wrong sender to other terminals — and under a rename-to-taken-name race, prompt responses could route back to the wrong terminal entirely. Hub now spread-normalizes `from` for all routed client messages, matching the existing `status_update` pattern.
- **`/link-name` no longer updates local `terminalName` before the hub confirms the rename.** Previously the client branch optimistically set `terminalName = newName` before reconnect, so during the close→reconnect→welcome window `/link` and `link_list` would report the requested name even if the hub later deduped it. Local identity now stays at the pre-rename value until `welcome` arrives. Notification wording updated from "Reconnecting as" to "Reconnecting, requesting" to reflect that the hub may assign a different name.
- **Hub promotion now preserves a pending client rename request.** Same-release follow-up to the previous bullet: with `terminalName` no longer updated optimistically, a client whose previous hub vanished mid-rename and who then wins hub promotion via `startHub` would otherwise have announced under the old local name. A `pendingClientRename` flag, set in `/link-name` and cleared on `welcome`, lets `startHub` adopt the requested name only when a rename was in flight. Hub-assigned deduped names from prior welcomes are otherwise preserved — no general `preferredName` replay.

---

## 0.1.11 — 2026-04-27

### Added

- **`pi-link list` command.** Lists pi-link sessions in the current cwd. Use `--all` (or `-a`) to list sessions across all directories — adds a CWD column with `~` substituted for `$HOME`. Shows name, last-modified time, message count, and short ID. Sessions are detected by presence of a `link-name` entry. ANSI styling (bold headers, dim secondary columns) in TTY; plain when piped (`NO_COLOR` honored).

---

## 0.1.10 — 2026-04-26

### Changed

- **`pi-link start <name>` simplified to `pi-link <name>`.** Resolves session by name and launches Pi directly. `pi-link resolve <name>` available for machine-readable path-only output. Rejects conflicting flags (`--session`, `--continue`, etc.).

- **`--link-name` flag replaced with `PI_LINK_NAME` env var.** The flag was a footgun — `pi --link-name worker-1` created duplicate sessions on every run. Now `pi-link <name>` passes the name via env var internally. Users should use `pi-link <name>` or `/link-name` mid-session.

### Fixed

- **Stale extension context crash on startup.** WebSocket callbacks could fire after Pi invalidated the extension context (~1ms after `session_start` returns), causing unhandled exceptions that killed the process. Fixed with deferred startup connect, safe context helpers, and `disposed` guards on all WebSocket callback sites.

---

## 0.1.9 — 2026-04-23

### Added

- **`--link-name <name>` flag.** Connect to link with a chosen terminal name on startup. Implies `--link`. Persists the name and sets the Pi session name if currently unnamed. Session resume by name is handled separately by the `pi-link` CLI. Name precedence: `--link-name` > saved `/link-name` > session name > random `t-xxxx`.

---

## 0.1.8 — 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Idle-gated batched delivery for `triggerTurn:true`.** `link_send` with `triggerTurn:true` no longer calls `pi.sendMessage()` immediately. Messages queue in a local inbox, coalesce over a 200ms debounce window, and flush only when the receiver is idle (`ctx.isIdle()`). Delivered as a single `[Link: N message(s) received]` block at the start of a fresh turn. Avoids a Pi platform race where mid-run steering messages can be stranded. `triggerTurn:false` is unchanged (immediate fire-and-forget). (`82977ec`, `ca2996b`)

- **Session name as default terminal identity.** When no explicit `/link-name` is saved for a session, the terminal now adopts the Pi session name instead of a random `t-xxxx` ID. The session name is used at runtime only — it is not saved as `preferredName`, so only explicit `/link-name` calls persist across sessions.

### Changed

- **Removed per-item truncation, raised batch cap.** Deleted the `ITEM_MAX_CHARS` (2 000) constant — it was silently cutting real agent work mid-word. `BATCH_MAX_CHARS` raised from 8 000 → 16 000 (~4K tokens). The batch cap is a soft limit: the first item is always included even if oversized, so one large message fills the batch alone and defers others to the next flush.

### Fixed

- **`flushInbox()` used `pi.isIdle()` instead of `ctx.isIdle()`.** `isIdle()` lives on `ExtensionContext`, not `ExtensionAPI`. Fixed to use the stored `ctx`.

---

## 0.1.7 — 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Bundled `pi-link-coordination` skill.** The coordination guide is now shipped with the package via `pi.skills` manifest entry. Installing pi-link now auto-loads the skill — no manual copy required. The skill provides on-demand guidance for agents delegating work across terminals: tool selection (`link_prompt` vs `link_send`), the golden rule (no sync-after-async on same target), callback contracts, and coordination modes.

---

## 0.1.6 — 2026-04-03

**Pi 0.65.0 migration.** Pi removed `session_switch` and `session_fork` events. All session transitions (startup, reload, `/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`) now fire `session_start` with `event.reason`. Each transition tears down the old extension runtime via `session_shutdown` before creating a fresh one — so there is no live connection to update in-place across sessions.

### Added

- **Persistent connection intent.** `/link-connect` and `/link-disconnect` now save their state to the session via `pi.appendEntry("link-active", ...)`. On `session_start`, the saved preference is checked before falling back to `--link`. Connect once and it stays connected across session resumes without needing the flag. Explicit user intent (`link-active`) takes precedence over the `--link` flag default.

### Removed

- **`cwd_update` message type.** With the old `session_switch` gone, mid-session cwd changes have no trigger. Working directories are now only reported on connect (via `register`/`welcome`). Protocol returns to 9 message types.

- **`session_switch` handler.** The 77-line in-place mutation matrix (hub rename, cwd diffing, client reconnect) is dead under the new lifecycle. Replaced by a unified `session_start` handler + `shouldConnect()` helper.

---

## 0.1.5 — 2026-04-02

### Added

- **Working directory sharing.** Each terminal reports its `cwd` on connect and on session switch. New `cwd_update` protocol message (10th message type) broadcasts mid-session directory changes. `link_list` and `/link` now show per-terminal working directories — full absolute paths in tool output, `~/…` shortened in the TUI. Agents can use this to choose the right target, use explicit paths when terminals differ, and catch wrong-project mistakes early.

- **Header comment cleanup.** Simplified the top-of-file doc comment — removed feature bullet list and install instructions in favor of a concise summary.

---

## 0.1.4 — 2026-03-30

### Added

- **Heartbeat-based prompt timeout.** `link_prompt` no longer uses a fixed 2-minute timeout. The target sends keepalives every 30s while working (reusing `status_update`). The sender resets a 90-second inactivity timer on each keepalive. A 30-minute hard ceiling prevents broken-but-chatty targets from hanging forever. Long tasks with regular activity no longer false-timeout. (`fc73a00`, `5603f0d`)

- **Self-target rejection.** `link_prompt` immediately rejects prompts where `to` equals your own terminal name, instead of sending a round-trip that would fail. (`0086c04`)

- **Immediate failure on disconnect.** Pending `link_prompt` calls fail instantly when the target terminal leaves the network (`terminal_left`), instead of waiting for the inactivity timeout. (`0086c04`)

- **`cleanupPending()` helper.** Single authority for resolving pending prompt state — all paths (response, inactivity, ceiling, abort, disconnect, delivery failure) go through one function, preventing double-resolution races. (`fc73a00`)

---

## 0.1.3 — 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Persistent link names.** `/link-name` saves your preferred name to the session via `pi.appendEntry()`. Resume a session and your name is restored automatically. Session switches (`/resume`) restore the new session's preferred name. Only explicit `/link-name` calls persist — hub-assigned variants like `"builder-2"` are not saved. (`369cf5d`)

### Fixed

- **Self join/leave echoes suppressed.** Hub no longer sends `terminal_joined`/`terminal_left` back to the terminal that triggered the event (e.g., during renames). Previously, renaming on the hub would echo a leave/join pair back to yourself. (`45cb018`)

- **Pre-flight target validation for `link_prompt`.** The sender now checks if the target exists in the local terminal list before sending, returning an immediate error with the current terminal list instead of waiting for a timeout. (`45cb018`)

---

## 0.1.2 — 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Automatic agent status.** Each terminal's activity status is derived from Pi lifecycle events and broadcast across the link. Three states: `idle`, `thinking`, `tool:<name>` — each with a duration computed at render time. New `status_update` protocol message (push model: terminal → hub → all). New joiners receive a status snapshot in the `welcome` message. (`454415a`)

- `/link` and `link_list` now show per-terminal status alongside names.

---

## 0.1.1 — 2026-03-22

### Changed

- **Published to npm.** Install command changed from `pi install git:github.com/alvivar/pi-mesh` to `pi install npm:pi-link`. (`87b394f`, `ed1e6cf`)

---

## 0.1.0 — 2026-03-22

First npm publish. Renamed from `pi-mesh` to `pi-link`. (`57bda8b`)

Everything below shipped together as the initial release.

### Core

- **Hub-spoke WebSocket network** on `127.0.0.1:9900`. First terminal becomes the hub; others connect as clients. All messages route through the hub. (`c239a9e`)

- **Auto-discovery protocol.** Try client → fallback to hub → retry with 2–5s randomized backoff on race conditions. (`c239a9e`)

- **Hub promotion.** When the hub goes down, the first client to reconnect becomes the new hub (race-based, no leader election). (`c239a9e`)

### Tools

- **`link_send`** — fire-and-forget message to a specific terminal or `"*"` for broadcast. Optional `triggerTurn` to kick off the remote LLM via `deliverAs: "steer"`. (`c239a9e`)

- **`link_prompt`** — synchronous RPC: send a prompt to a remote terminal, wait for the LLM's response. Single-queue per terminal (immediate `"Terminal is busy"` rejection, no queuing). 2-minute fixed timeout at this version. (`c239a9e`)

- **`link_list`** — list connected terminals with role info and self-identification. (`c239a9e`)

### Commands

- **`/link`** — show link status (name, role, online count). (`c239a9e`)
- **`/link-name [name]`** — rename this terminal. No-arg form adopts the Pi session name. (`c239a9e`, `2fd67c7`)
- **`/link-broadcast <msg>`** — broadcast a chat message to all other terminals. (`c0bf65a`)
- **`/link-connect`** — connect mid-session without `--link` flag. Enables auto-reconnect. (`a2a0eac`)
- **`/link-disconnect`** — disconnect and suppress auto-reconnect, even if `--link` was passed. (`a2a0eac`)

### Opt-in startup

- **`--link` flag.** Link is off by default — completely silent without the flag. No status bar, no connection attempts, no warnings. (`48d7e97`)

### Protocol hardening (pre-release)

These fixes shipped before 0.1.0 but are worth noting as they shaped the protocol:

- **Early failure on missing targets.** Hub sends `prompt_response` with error for unknown targets, so the sender's promise resolves immediately instead of timing out. (`da38f62`)
- **Delivery status from routing.** `routeMessage()` returns a boolean — authoritative on the hub, optimistic on clients. (`a29fefc`)
- **Unique name enforcement.** Hub deduplicates names (`builder` → `builder-2`). Renames check for collisions. No-op renames short-circuit. (`84d2b68`, `1207647`)
- **Unregistered client guard.** Hub ignores all non-`register` messages from clients that haven't completed registration. (`679f25f`)
- **Session names as defaults.** Terminals use the Pi session name as their default link identity when available. (`2fd67c7`)
