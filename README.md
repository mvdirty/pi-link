# pi-link

A WebSocket-based inter-terminal communication system that creates a local network between multiple Pi coding agent terminals. Enables terminals to discover each other, exchange messages, and orchestrate work across agents - all automatically on `localhost`.

> Three patterns out of the box: ask another agent for an answer (`link_prompt`), delegate async work (`link_send` with `triggerTurn:true`), or broadcast to every other terminal (`/link-broadcast`). Start two Pi terminals with `--link` — they find each other automatically.

## Why?

A single Pi terminal is powerful. Multiple terminals working together unlock new patterns:

- **Research + Build** - one terminal investigates APIs, docs, or logs while another writes code based on the findings.
- **Fan-out** - split a large task across agents (e.g., "terminal A handles the backend, terminal B handles the frontend") and collect results.
- **Orchestrator / Worker** - designate one terminal as a coordinator that delegates subtasks to others via `link_prompt` and assembles the final output.
- **Review pipeline** - one terminal writes code, another reviews it, back and forth until both are satisfied.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), version **0.74 or later** (for pi-link 0.1.15+). On Pi ≤0.73, pin `pi-link@0.1.14`.
- Node.js (LTS recommended)

---

## Quick Start

### Install

The minimum install — enables every in-Pi feature (`/link`, `link_send`, `link_prompt`, `/link-connect`, `--link` flag, auto-resume, all LLM tools):

```bash
pi install npm:pi-link
```

That's it. For most users this is all you need.

#### Optional: shell launcher

If you also want the `pi-link <name>` shell command to start named sessions from a terminal prompt (e.g. `pi-link builder` in one window, `pi-link reviewer` in another), install the CLI globally as well:

```bash
npm i -g pi-link
```

Or install both in one line:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-link && npm i -g pi-link
```

The shell launcher is convenience-only — you can always reach the same functionality from inside Pi via `/link-connect` and `/link-name <name>`.

### Uninstall

```bash
pi uninstall npm:pi-link      # Remove Pi extension
npm uninstall -g pi-link      # Remove CLI launcher (if you installed it)
```

### Usage

Link is **off by default**. Two ways to start:

```bash
pi --link            # try it now, random name like t-a3f9
pi-link mybot        # named session you can resume by name
```

Already in a session? Use `/link-connect`. Use `/link` any time to check status, or let the LLM tools handle cross-terminal coordination. See [Session Resume](#session-resume) for `pi-link <name>` details.

### Notes on installation

**Why two installs?** Pi 0.75 installs Pi packages into a private npm root (`~/.pi/agent/npm/`) for safer permission handling ([pi-mono#4587](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/4587)). That's where the Pi extension lives, but it means the `pi-link` shell command is no longer on system PATH. `npm i -g pi-link` puts it on PATH separately. Both installs are safe to use together.

---

## Walkthrough

Here's a concrete example of two terminals collaborating. Open two separate `pi --link` sessions.

**Terminal 1** - rename and check status:

```
> /link-name builder
✓ Renamed to "builder"

> /link
⚡ Link: builder (hub) · 2 online
  builder: idle (5s) · 45K/272K (17%)
    cwd: ~/my-project
  researcher: idle (12s) · 80K/272K (29%)
    cwd: ~/my-project
```

**Terminal 2** - rename it too:

```
> /link-name researcher
✓ Reconnecting, requesting "researcher" (hub may assign a different name if taken)...
```

**Now ask Terminal 1's LLM to delegate work:**

In Terminal 1, type a normal prompt:

```
> Use link_prompt to ask "researcher" to summarize the contents of README.md in this directory
```

The LLM in Terminal 1 calls `link_prompt` → Terminal 2's LLM receives the prompt, reads the file, and sends back a summary → Terminal 1's LLM presents the result to you.

**Or broadcast a message to all terminals:**

```
> /link-broadcast starting the deployment pipeline
✓ Broadcast sent
```

Every other terminal sees:

```
⚡ [builder] starting the deployment pipeline
```

---

## Configuration

Link is **off by default**. Without `--link`, `--link-name`, or `pi-link`, the extension is completely silent — no status bar, no connections, no warnings.

**Naming concepts**

- **link name** — identity used on the network (visible in `link_list`, `/link`, prompts).
- **Pi session name** — identity Pi gives the session itself; lives in the session JSONL's latest `session_info` entry.
- **saved link name** — the link name persisted to the session, restored on resume. Set by `/link-name`, `pi-link <name>`, or `pi --link-name <name>`.
- **`--link-name` flag vs `/link-name` command** — same concept (the link name) at different times (startup vs mid-session).

| What you want                        | Use                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Resume/create a named session        | `pi-link <name>`        |
| Stable link identity, normal Pi flow | `pi --link-name <name>` |
| Quick try, random name               | `pi --link`             |
| Already in a session                 | `/link-connect`         |
| Disconnect mid-session               | `/link-disconnect`      |

`pi-link <name>` resumes/creates a session AND sets your link identity in one step. `pi --link-name <name>` sets only the link identity, leaving Pi's normal session selection (latest in cwd, or fresh) untouched.

**Name normalization:** Link names are normalized — leading/trailing whitespace removed and internal whitespace runs collapsed to a single space. `/link-name "build   lead"` saves and shows as `build lead`.

**Name precedence:** `pi --link-name` > `pi-link <name>` > saved `/link-name` > Pi session name > random `t-xxxx`. _(The `pi-link` wrapper itself does not accept `--link-name`; pick one or the other.)_

`/link-connect` and `/link-disconnect` save their intent to the session — resume later and the connection state is restored without needing the flag. Explicit user intent takes precedence over `--link`.

Once connected, terminals discover each other on `127.0.0.1:9900`. See [Limitations](#limitations--design-decisions) for the hardcoded port.

### Session Resume

Pi's `--session` flag requires a file path, not a display name. `pi-link` bridges this — it resolves a session by name and launches Pi directly:

```bash
pi-link worker-1                # resume or create session "worker-1"
pi-link worker-1 --model sonnet # with extra Pi flags
```

How it works: `pi-link worker-1` scans Pi's session directory, finds the session named "worker-1", and spawns `pi --session <path> --link`. Session-dir resolution matches Pi's lookup order: `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` env > `<cwd>/.pi/settings.json` `sessionDir` > `<agentDir>/settings.json` `sessionDir` > default `<agentDir>/sessions/`. `<agentDir>` follows `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` and defaults to `~/.pi/agent/`.

Lookup is **scoped to the current cwd by default**; pass `--global` (`-g`) to consider sessions in any cwd.

- **One match in scope** → resumes that session
- **No match in scope** → creates a new session in the current cwd. If matches exist outside the scope, prints a hint pointing at `--global`.
- **Multiple matches in scope** → prints candidates to stderr, exits 1
- **Conflicting flags** (`--session`, `--continue`, `--resume`, `--fork`, etc.) → rejected with an error

### Discovering sessions

`pi-link --list` shows pi-link sessions in the current cwd; `pi-link --list --global` (or `-g`) lists them across all directories. Sorted by last activity — starting a session with the same name it already has does not bump recency; only real activity (messages, tool calls, edits, name changes) does.

```
$ pi-link --list
NAME             MODIFIED  MESSAGES  ID
opus@pi-link     2m ago    4632      6332faab
gpt@pi-link      5m ago    1493      20d43841

Resume: pi-link <name>
```

With `--global`:

```
$ pi-link --list --global
NAME             CWD                   MODIFIED  MESSAGES  ID
opus@pi-link     ~/my-project          2m ago    4632      6332faab
gpt@pi-link      ~/other-project       5m ago    1493      20d43841

Resume: pi-link <name>
```

`--global` adds a `CWD` column with `~` substituted for `$HOME`. Output is plain when piped (`NO_COLOR` honored).

`pi-link <name>` and `pi-link --resolve <name>` follow the same scoping: local cwd by default, `--global` (or `-g`) widens. When `pi-link <name>` finds no local match but matches exist elsewhere, it warns and points at `--global` instead of silently jumping cwds.

For scripting, `pi-link --resolve <name>` prints just the session path (machine-readable, no other output). Exit codes: `0` on single match, `1` if ambiguous (multiple matches printed to stderr), `2` if not found.

---

## LLM Tools

The extension registers four tools that the LLM can invoke during agent runs. pi-link also ships with a bundled **pi-link-coordination** skill that gives agents on-demand guidance for tool selection, delegation patterns, and avoiding common coordination mistakes.

### Which tool should I use?

| Tool           | Behavior                                             | Returns                                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `link_send`    | Send a message; optionally trigger the remote LLM    | Send/delivery status only                           |
| `link_prompt`  | Run a prompt on a remote terminal and wait for reply | The remote terminal's assistant response            |
| `link_list`    | List currently connected terminals                   | Terminal list with roles, status, cwd, and context  |
| `link_compact` | Ask another terminal to compact its context window   | Waits for completion; returns compacted or an error |

**If you need the other terminal's answer back, use `link_prompt`.** Use `link_send` to notify or steer without waiting.

### `link_send`

Send a fire-and-forget chat message to a specific terminal or broadcast to all.

| Parameter     | Type      | Description                                          |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `to`          | `string`  | Target terminal name, or `"*"` for broadcast         |
| `message`     | `string`  | Message content                                      |
| `triggerTurn` | `boolean` | If `true`, the receiver's LLM responds automatically |

When `triggerTurn` is enabled, the message is queued in the receiver's local inbox. Nearby arrivals are coalesced (200ms debounce), and delivery is gated on the receiving agent being idle - ensuring it starts a clean new turn. Messages arrive as a single `[Link: N message(s) received]` block at the top of a fresh turn, not mid-run. When `triggerTurn` is `false` or omitted, delivery is immediate fire-and-forget.

Note: `triggerTurn` does **not** cause the response to come back to the caller - use `link_prompt` for that.

> **Broadcast note:** Sending to `"*"` delivers to **all other terminals** - the sender is excluded.

Pre-validates the target name against the local terminal list before sending, catching typos early. See [Message Routing](#message-routing--error-handling) for delivery semantics. **Self-target rejection** - sending to yourself (`to` equals your own name) returns an immediate error.

### `link_prompt`

Send a prompt to a remote terminal and **wait** for the LLM's response (synchronous RPC pattern).

| Parameter | Type     | Description          |
| --------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| `to`      | `string` | Target terminal name |
| `prompt`  | `string` | Prompt text to send  |

- The remote terminal processes the prompt via `pi.sendUserMessage()` - as if a user typed it.
- Returns the remote terminal's actual assistant reply text as the tool result.
- **Self-target rejection** - prompting yourself (`to` equals your own name) returns an immediate error.
- **Heartbeat-based timeout** - no short fixed deadline. The target sends keepalives every 30s while working. The sender resets a 90-second inactivity timer on each keepalive. A 30-minute hard ceiling acts as a safety net against broken-but-chatty targets. A 10-minute task with regular activity never times out; a genuinely dead target times out in 90 seconds of silence.
- **Immediate failure on disconnect** - if the target leaves the network (`terminal_left`), pending prompts to that target fail immediately instead of waiting for the inactivity timeout.
- **Early failure detection** - if the message can't be delivered (e.g., target not found), the tool resolves immediately with an error instead of waiting for the timeout.
- Supports abort signals.
- Targets **one terminal at a time** (no broadcast mode).
- Only **one remote prompt** can execute at a time per target terminal. Concurrent requests are rejected with `"Terminal is busy"`.

### `link_list`

Lists all connected terminals with role info, live agent status, working directory, context usage, and self-identification. Takes no parameters.

Each terminal reports its current working directory on connect. `link_list` shows the full absolute path so agents can choose the right target, use explicit paths when terminals differ, and catch wrong-project mistakes early.

Each terminal also reports its current LLM context usage, rendered as `45K/272K (17%)` — tokens used over the context window, with percent. Briefly after compaction it shows as `?/272K` until the next live token count arrives. Treat it as an advisory signal when choosing a worker; prefer a less-loaded terminal for context-heavy delegation.

Each terminal's status is derived automatically from Pi lifecycle events - agents can't set it manually. Three states:

| Status            | Meaning                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| `idle (2m)`       | Waiting for user input  |
| `thinking (3s)`   | LLM is generating       |
| `tool:bash (12s)` | Running a specific tool |

Durations are computed at render time from a `since` timestamp - no timer traffic over the wire. Terminals that just joined with no status data yet render as blank, not fake idle.

Working directories use full absolute paths in tool output. In the TUI (`/link`), paths are shortened to `~/...` when possible to keep the display compact.

**Example output:**

```
Connected terminals:
  • opus@pi-link (you)  idle (12s)  · 45K/272K (17%)
    cwd: C:\Users\andre\.pi
  • gpt@pi-link  thinking (3s)  · ?/272K
    cwd: C:\Users\andre\.pi
  • docs@pi-link  idle (1m)  · 90K/272K (33%)
    cwd: C:\Users\andre\.pi
```

### `link_compact`

Ask another terminal to compact its context window and **wait** until it finishes — so the very next call can dispatch new work to the freshly trimmed worker without a busy bounce.

| Parameter      | Type     | Description                                            |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `to`           | `string` | Target terminal name                                   |
| `instructions` | `string` | Optional custom compaction instructions for the target |

- The remote terminal runs `ctx.compact()` — the same code path as `/compact`. The call returns once the runtime reports completion.
- **Success** result: `Compacted "<name>"`. The worker is now idle with a trimmed context, ready for the next dispatch.
- **Busy decline** — if the target is mid-turn or already compacting, it declines immediately with `reason: "busy"`. `link_compact` will **not** interrupt active work; retry when `link_list` shows the worker idle.
- **Self-target rejection** — calling `link_compact` on yourself returns an error pointing at `/compact`.
- **Flat 180-second timeout** — compaction typically takes 5–60s; if the target stops responding mid-compaction the call resolves with a timeout error.
- Supports abort signals.
- Targets **one terminal at a time** (no broadcast mode). To compact several workers concurrently, issue parallel tool calls.
- **No consent or capability gate** — any connected terminal can request compaction on any other; link participants are cooperating peers.

### Coordination recipes

The four tools compose into coordination shapes worth naming:

- **Fan-out** - split independent subtasks across several terminals with `link_send(triggerTurn: true)`, keep working, then synthesize the callbacks. Parallelizes work that doesn't share a sequence. If a worker's context (visible in `link_list`) runs high, `link_compact` trims it and returns when the worker is idle — feed it the next subtask immediately.
- **Adversarial review** - have one terminal produce or edit work, then `link_prompt` another to critique it. Because `link_prompt` blocks on a reply from a separate session, the critique lands in the same turn; feed it back or revise locally.
- **Independent cross-check** - send the same verification question to two terminals without sharing their answers, then reconcile - or ask a third to resolve disagreements. Separate contexts mean neither anchors on the other.

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/link`                 | Show link status (name, role, online count, agent status, context usage, and cwd per terminal)                           |
| `/link-name [name]`     | Rename and save as this session's preferred link name. With no argument, adopts the Pi session name. Restored on resume. |
| `/link-broadcast <msg>` | Broadcast a chat message to all other terminals                                                                          |
| `/link-connect`         | Connect to Pi Link (works anytime, with or without `--link`)                                                             |
| `/link-disconnect`      | Disconnect from Pi Link and suppress auto-reconnect (overrides `--link`)                                                 |

### Examples

```
> /link
⚡ Link: builder (hub) · 3 online
  builder: idle (12s) · 45K/272K (17%)
    cwd: ~/my-project
  worker-1: thinking (3s) · ?/272K
    cwd: ~/my-project
  worker-2: tool:bash (5s) · 180K/272K (66%)
    cwd: ~/other-project

> /link-name orchestrator
✓ Renamed to "orchestrator"

> /link-name
✓ Renamed to "my-session"

> /link-broadcast starting the build pipeline
✓ Broadcast sent

> /link-disconnect
✓ Disconnected from link

> /link-connect
✓ Joined link as "orchestrator" (3 online)
```

With no argument, `/link-name` adopts the Pi session name. `/link-connect` joins an existing hub if one is running; otherwise it starts the hub.

**Name persistence:** `/link-name` saves your preferred name to the session. Resume later and it's restored automatically. If the name is taken, the hub assigns a variant (e.g., `"builder-2"`), but your preferred name stays saved for the next reconnect. See [Name Uniqueness & Persistence](#name-uniqueness--persistence) for details.

See [Configuration](#configuration) for details on `--link`, `/link-connect`, and `/link-disconnect` behavior.

## Architecture

### Hub-Spoke Topology

The network topology is **hub-spoke (star)**:

```
                       +-----------+
                       |    Hub    |
                       |   :9900   |
                       +-----+-----+
                             |
              +--------------+--------------+
              |              |              |
          +---+---+      +---+---+      +---+---+
          | pi-2  |      | pi-3  |      | pi-4  |
          |client |      |client |      |client |
          +-------+      +-------+      +-------+
```

- The **first terminal** to start becomes the **hub** - it runs a `WebSocketServer` on `127.0.0.1:9900`.
- **Subsequent terminals** connect as **clients** via plain WebSocket.
- All messages route **through the hub**; clients never talk directly to each other.

### Auto-Discovery Protocol

The discovery sequence runs on startup (with `--link` or `pi-link`) or when `/link-connect` is used. See [Configuration](#configuration) for details.

The sequence is a simple fallback:

1. Attempt to connect as a **client** to `127.0.0.1:9900`.
2. If connection fails → become the **hub** (start a WebSocket server on that port).
3. If both fail (rare race condition) → retry after a randomized 2-5 second backoff.

### Hub Promotion

When the hub disconnects, clients detect the WebSocket close event, enter `"disconnected"` state, and call `scheduleReconnect()`. The **first terminal to retry** becomes the new hub via the same initialize-or-fallback flow.

There is **no explicit leader election** - promotion is race-based.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port 9900 is already in use

If another process occupies port 9900, the terminal can't become the hub. It will attempt to connect as a client instead (which also fails if there's no real hub), then retry after 2-5 seconds. Free the port or modify `DEFAULT_PORT` in `index.ts` - see [Limitations](#limitations--design-decisions).

### "Terminal is busy" rejections

Each terminal handles **one remote operation at a time** — a local agent run, an incoming `link_prompt`, or a `link_compact` all block the others. If a `link_prompt` arrives while the terminal is busy, it's immediately rejected with `"Terminal is busy"`. There is no queuing. Solutions:

- Wait for the target terminal to finish its current task.
- Spread prompts across multiple worker terminals.
- Have the sender retry after a delay.

A `link_compact` to a busy target behaves the same way — the call resolves with `Compact on "<target>" not done: busy` instead of interrupting active work. Retry when `link_list` shows the worker idle.

### Terminals don't see each other

- Verify both terminals are on the same machine (the link only works on `127.0.0.1`).
- Run `/link` in each terminal to check status.
- Ensure port 9900 isn't blocked or occupied by a non-link process.

### Hub promotion loses state

When the hub goes down and a client promotes itself, terminal names and in-flight prompts from the old hub session are lost. All surviving clients reconnect and re-register. This is by design - see [Limitations](#limitations--design-decisions).

## Limitations & Design Decisions

| #   | Decision                                  | Rationale / Impact                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **No authentication**                     | Any localhost process can connect to port 9900. Acceptable for local dev; don't expose the port externally.                                                                                                     |
| 2   | **Hardcoded port (9900)**                 | Not configurable without editing `DEFAULT_PORT` in `index.ts`. Could conflict with other services on the same port.                                                                                             |
| 3   | **Race-based hub promotion**              | Non-deterministic. Terminal state (names, in-flight prompts) is lost during promotion. Simple but imperfect.                                                                                                    |
| 4   | **Single remote prompt per terminal**     | No queuing - immediate rejection if busy. See [`link_prompt`](#link_prompt) and [Troubleshooting](#terminal-is-busy-rejections).                                                                                |
| 5   | **No message persistence**                | Purely ephemeral WebSocket frames. Messages are lost if the recipient is offline.                                                                                                                               |
| 6   | **Client rename triggers full reconnect** | Changing a client's name requires a new `register` message, so the client disconnects and reconnects. Hub renames are handled in-place with collision checks.                                                   |
| 7   | **Single-machine / localhost-only**       | Link only binds to `127.0.0.1`; terminals on different machines cannot join.                                                                                                                                    |
| 8   | **Rename during prompt loses keepalives** | If the target renames mid-prompt, keepalive resets stop working (pending requests track by name). The final response can still succeed by request ID, but inactivity may false-fire on long tasks after rename. |

### Protocol

The wire protocol consists of **11 message types**, all serialized as JSON over WebSocket frames. Cwd and context fields are optional.

| Type               | Direction       | Purpose                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `register`         | Client → Hub    | First message after connecting; requests a name, optionally reports cwd and context |
| `welcome`          | Hub → Client    | Confirms assigned name, terminal list + status/cwd/context snapshots                |
| `terminal_joined`  | Hub → All       | Broadcast when a terminal joins; may include cwd and context                        |
| `terminal_left`    | Hub → All       | Broadcast when a terminal disconnects                                               |
| `chat`             | Any → Any/All   | Fire-and-forget message; optionally triggers LLM turn                               |
| `prompt_request`   | Any → Any       | Request a remote terminal to execute a prompt                                       |
| `prompt_response`  | Any → Any       | Response carrying the remote prompt result                                          |
| `compact_request`  | Any → Any       | Request a remote terminal to compact its context; awaits a response                 |
| `compact_response` | Any → Any       | Completion/failure response for a compact_request                                   |
| `status_update`    | Any → Hub → All | Terminal broadcasts agent status change; carries updated context                    |
| `error`            | Hub → Client    | Error notification                                                                  |

### Message Flow Examples

**Joining the link:**

```
Client                         Hub
  |                             |
  | register {name:"builder",   |
  |           cwd:"C:\\Users\\..."} |
  |---------------------------->|
  |                             |
  | welcome {name, terminals,   |
  | statuses, cwds}             |
  |<----------------------------|
  |                             |
```

Hub then broadcasts `terminal_joined` to the other connected terminals. The `welcome` message includes status, cwd, and context snapshots for all connected terminals (fields omitted above for brevity). `terminal_joined` also includes the new terminal's optional cwd and context.

**Sending a chat message:**

```
Client A            Hub              Client B
  |                  |                  |
  | chat {to:pi-2}   |                  |
  |----------------->|                  |
  |                  | chat {from:A}    |
  |                  |----------------->|
  |                  |                  |
```

**Remote prompt (synchronous RPC):**

```
Client A            Hub              Client B
  |                  |                  |
  | prompt_request   |                  |
  |----------------->|                  |
  |                  | prompt_request   |
  |                  |----------------->|
  |                  |   (LLM runs)     |
  |                  |<-----------------|
  | prompt_response  |                  |
  |<-----------------|                  |
```

### Name Uniqueness & Persistence

The hub enforces unique terminal names via a `uniqueName()` function. If `"builder"` is already taken, the next terminal requesting that name is assigned `"builder-2"`, then `"builder-3"`, and so on.

Default names are random 4-character hex IDs: `t-a1b2`, `t-c3d4`, etc.

**Persistence:** `/link-name` saves the preferred name to the session via `pi.appendEntry("link-name", { name })`. On session resume, the saved name is restored and requested from the hub. Only explicit `/link-name` calls persist - hub-assigned variants like `"builder-2"` are not saved. On reconnect, the terminal always requests the preferred name, not the last runtime name.

**Rename guards:**

- If you're already using the requested name, `/link-name` returns early (`"Already using..."`).
- On the hub, renaming checks if the name is taken by another connected client before accepting the change.
- On a client, the rename triggers a reconnect; the hub enforces uniqueness during re-registration and may assign a different name if taken.

**Unregistered client guard:** The hub ignores all non-`register` messages from clients that haven't completed registration, preventing protocol violations from malformed or out-of-order messages.

### State Management

| State Field              | Type                                  | Purpose                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `stateSince`             | `number`                              | Timestamp of last status change (used for duration display)                                 |
| `currentCwd`             | `string`                              | Current working directory reported to peers on connect                                      |
| `inbox`                  | `array`                               | Queued `triggerTurn:true` messages awaiting idle-gated flush                                |
| `flushTimer`             | `Timer \| null`                       | Pending inbox flush (debounce or busy-retry)                                                |
| `disposed`               | `boolean`                             | Set on `session_shutdown`; guards all WebSocket callbacks against stale context             |
| `startupConnectTimer`    | `Timer \| null`                       | Deferred startup connect (`setTimeout(0)`) so Pi's startup cycle completes first            |
| `manuallyDisconnected`   | `boolean`                             | Set by `/link-disconnect`; suppresses auto-reconnect                                        |
| `pendingRemotePrompt`    | `object \| null`                      | Tracks the single in-flight remote prompt execution                                         |
| `pendingPromptResponses` | `Map`                                 | Outstanding prompt RPCs awaiting responses (includes inactivity + ceiling timers per entry) |

### Message Routing & Error Handling

`routeMessage()` returns a `boolean` indicating delivery status:

- **Hub** - delivery is authoritative. If the target terminal isn't connected, the hub sends a protocol-level error back to the sender. For `prompt_request` messages to unknown targets, the hub sends a `prompt_response` with an error field so the sender's pending promise resolves immediately rather than timing out. Likewise, a `compact_request` to an unknown target gets a synthesized `compact_response` (`ok: false`, `reason: "not_found"`), so a remote-compact call fails fast instead of waiting out its 180-second timeout.
- **Client** - delivery is optimistic (`true` means "sent to hub"). The hub handles routing and errors via the protocol.

### Connection Lifecycle

Internally, teardown is split into two functions:

- **`disconnect()`** - closes sockets, clears connection state, resolves pending promises. Used by `/link-disconnect` and called internally by `cleanup()`.
- **`cleanup()`** - calls `disconnect()`, sets `disposed = true`, clears `ctx`. Used on `session_shutdown`.

Three helpers protect WebSocket callbacks from stale extension context:

- **`getUi()`** - safely accesses `ctx.ui`, returns `null` if the context is invalidated.
- **`notify()`** - wraps `getUi()?.notify()` for safe notification delivery.
- **`isRuntimeLive()`** - returns `false` if `disposed` or context is stale; checked before processing any incoming WebSocket message.

Startup connect is deferred via `scheduleStartupConnect()` (`setTimeout(0)`) so Pi's startup cycle completes and the extension context is fully valid before WebSocket work begins.

The `manuallyDisconnected` flag distinguishes user-initiated disconnects (`/link-disconnect`) from connection loss. When set, `scheduleReconnect()` is suppressed - the terminal stays offline until `/link-connect` is explicitly called.

### Agent Lifecycle Integration

The extension hooks into Pi's agent lifecycle events:

- **`agent_start`** → Sets `agentRunning = true`, blocking incoming remote prompts. Broadcasts `status_update` (`thinking`).
- **`agent_end`** → Wakes up the inbox flush (idle-gated delivery for `triggerTurn:true` messages). Checks if a remote prompt was running; if so, extracts the last assistant response from `event.messages` and sends back a `prompt_response`. Broadcasts `status_update` (`idle`).
- **`tool_execution_start`** → Broadcasts `status_update` (`tool:<name>`).
- **`tool_execution_end`** → Clears tool status; broadcasts `status_update` (`thinking`) while the agent run continues.
- **`session_compact`** → Force-pushes a `status_update` so peers see the new (post-compaction) context usage immediately.
- **`session_shutdown`** → Full cleanup via `cleanup()`: closes all sockets, resolves pending promises, and disposes the extension.

Status updates are push-based: each terminal broadcasts changes to the hub, which fans them out. New joiners receive a status snapshot for all terminals in the `welcome` message.

While executing a remote prompt, the target sends a forced `status_update` every 30 seconds as a keepalive - reusing the existing status push mechanism. On the sender side, each incoming `status_update` from the target resets the 90-second inactivity timer. All resolution paths (response, inactivity, ceiling, abort, disconnect, delivery failure) go through a single `cleanupPending()` helper to prevent double-resolution races.

### Idle-Gated Inbox

When a `chat` message arrives with `triggerTurn:true`, it goes into a local inbox instead of calling `pi.sendMessage()` immediately. This avoids a Pi platform race where steering messages sent mid-agent-run can be stranded (see `REPORT-sendMessage-race.md`).

The flush pipeline:

1. **Debounce** - `scheduleFlush(FLUSH_DELAY_MS)` coalesces burst arrivals (200ms window).
2. **Idle gate** - `flushInbox()` checks `ctx.isIdle()`. If busy, retries every 500ms.
3. **Batch** - up to 20 messages or ~16 000 chars per delivery (soft cap - the first item is always included even if oversized).
4. **Deliver** - one `pi.sendMessage({ triggerTurn: true })` call with a `[Link: N message(s) received]` block.
5. **Drain** - if the inbox still has items, reschedule.

On `agent_end`, the inbox flush is kicked via `scheduleFlush(0)` - deferred to the next macrotask, by which time `ctx.isIdle()` returns `true`.

| Constant          | Value  | Purpose                                  |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `FLUSH_DELAY_MS`  | 200    | Burst debounce window                    |
| `IDLE_RETRY_MS`   | 500    | Busy-retry polling interval              |
| `BATCH_MAX_ITEMS` | 20     | Max messages per batch                   |
| `BATCH_MAX_CHARS` | 16 000 | Soft cap on batch text size (~4K tokens) |

### Rendering

Incoming link chat messages render with a styled `⚡ [sender]` prefix using the theme's accent color. The link status text in Pi's footer uses `theme.fg("dim", ...)` to match Pi's standard footer styling.
