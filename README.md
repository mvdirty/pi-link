# pi-link

A WebSocket-based inter-terminal communication system that creates a local network between multiple Pi coding agent terminals. Enables terminals to discover each other, exchange messages, and orchestrate work across agents - all automatically on `localhost`.

> Message another Pi terminal with `link_send`. Replies are ordinary messages the other agent chooses to send, not automatic responses. Start two Pi terminals with `--link` — they find each other automatically.

Questions, ideas? There's a [pi-link thread](https://discord.com/channels/1456806362351669492/1485515696719921183) in the official Pi Discord.

## Why?

A single Pi terminal is powerful. Multiple terminals working together unlock new patterns:

- **Research + Build** - one terminal investigates APIs, docs, or logs while another writes code based on the findings.
- **Parallel work** - split a large task across agents (e.g., "terminal A handles the backend, terminal B handles the frontend") and collect results.
- **Orchestrator / Worker** - designate one terminal as a coordinator that delegates subtasks with `link_send`, tracks callbacks, and assembles the final output.
- **Review pipeline** - one terminal writes code, another reviews it, back and forth until both are satisfied.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), version **0.84.2 or later** (for pi-link 0.3+). On Pi 0.74–0.84.1, pin `pi-link@0.2.x`; on Pi ≤0.73, pin `pi-link@0.1.14`.
- Node.js (LTS recommended)

Pi's package installation does not check the host version, so `pi install` succeeds on an older Pi. pi-link then refuses to initialize instead of half-running: it throws before registering anything, and Pi reports it under **[Extension issues]** with the required minimum and the version it detected. Nothing else about the session changes.

---

## Quick Start

### Install

The minimum install — enables every in-Pi feature (`/link`, `link_send`, `/link-connect`, `--link` flag, auto-resume, and all LLM tools):

```bash
pi install npm:pi-link
```

That's it. For most users this is all you need.

#### Optional: shell launcher

If you also want the `pi-link <name>` shell command to start named sessions from a terminal prompt (e.g. `pi-link builder` in one window, `pi-link reviewer` in another), install the CLI globally as well:

```bash
npm i -g pi-link
```

Or install both in one line:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-link && npm i -g pi-link
```

The shell launcher is convenience-only — you can always reach the same functionality from inside Pi via `/link-connect` and `/link-name <name>`.

### Uninstall

```bash
pi uninstall npm:pi-link      # Remove Pi extension
npm uninstall -g pi-link      # Remove CLI launcher (if you installed it)
```

### Usage

Link is **off by default**. Two ways to start:

```bash
pi --link            # try it now, random name like t-a3f9
pi-link mybot        # named session you can resume by name
```

Already in a session? Use `/link-connect`. Use `/link` any time to check status, or let the LLM tools handle cross-terminal coordination. See [Session Resume](#session-resume) for `pi-link <name>` details.

### Notes on installation

**Why two installs?** Pi 0.75 installs Pi packages into a private npm root (`~/.pi/agent/npm/`) for safer permission handling ([pi-mono#4587](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/4587)). That's where the Pi extension lives, but it means the `pi-link` shell command is no longer on system PATH. `npm i -g pi-link` puts it on PATH separately. Both installs are safe to use together.

---

## Walkthrough

Here's a concrete example of two terminals collaborating. Open two separate `pi --link` sessions.

**Terminal 1** - rename it:

```
> /link-name builder
✓ Renamed to "builder"
```

**Terminal 2** - rename it too:

```
> /link-name researcher
✓ Reconnecting, requesting "researcher" (hub may assign a different name if taken)...
```

`/link-name` reconnects under the new name, so wait for Terminal 2 to come back before checking. **Back in Terminal 1**, both names are now visible:

```
> /link
⚡ Link: builder (hub) · 2 online
  builder: idle (5s) · 45K/272K (17%)
    cwd: ~/my-project
  researcher: idle (12s) · 80K/272K (29%)
    cwd: ~/my-project
```

**Now ask Terminal 1's LLM to delegate work:**

In Terminal 1, type a normal prompt:

```
> Use link_send to ask "researcher" to summarize README.md, then report DONE with the summary back to builder
```

Terminal 1 calls `link_send` and returns immediately. The message enters Terminal 2's reasoning — steered into its current run if it is working, or starting a turn if it is idle. Terminal 2 completes the assignment, then sends a conventional `DONE` callback. That callback enters Terminal 1 the same way, where the result can be presented or used for follow-up work.

---

## LLM Tools

The extension registers three tools. `link_send` is the sole agent messaging tool; `link_list` provides discovery and status, and `link_compact` is a separate bounded blocking operation. pi-link also ships a **pi-link-coordination** skill that explains how the tools behave.

### Which tool should I use?

| Tool           | Behavior                                                | Returns                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `link_send`    | Send a message to one other terminal                    | Reports whether sending started, not whether it arrived |
| `link_list`    | List currently connected terminals                      | Terminal list with roles, status, cwd, and context      |
| `link_compact` | Ask another terminal to compact and wait for its result | Compacted, declined, or failed                          |

### `link_send`

Send a message to one other terminal. The sender returns immediately.

| Parameter | Type     | Description          |
| --------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| `to`      | `string` | Target terminal name |
| `message` | `string` | Message content      |

When a message reaches the target terminal, it enters the receiver's inbox. Messages arriving close together may be delivered in one batch. The first message sets a delay of about 200ms; later messages do not extend it, so continuous traffic still gets delivered regularly. Each batch arrives as one `[Link: N message(s) received]` block, in arrival order, with each message under a `From "name":` header.

The receiver's state is read when that batch is delivered, not when it is sent. If the receiver is still running then, the batch is steered into that run at Pi's next safe boundary — current tool calls finish first, before the next LLM call. Otherwise it starts a turn. There is no way to send without entering the receiver's reasoning.

Each send has exactly one recipient; there is no fan-out.

`link_send` never returns the receiver's eventual work result. A reply is an ordinary later `link_send`, uncorrelated with the message that prompted it: there is no request ID, no automatic response, and no delivery receipt for completed work.

Targets are pre-validated against the local terminal list to catch definite typos or offline names. Sending to yourself is rejected. For a client, a successful send means the message was handed to its connection to the hub. It does not confirm that the hub routed it or that the receiver saw it — see [Message Routing](#message-routing--error-handling).

### `link_list`

Lists all connected terminals with role info, status, working directory, context usage, and self-identification. Takes no parameters. Your own status and context are read when you run `link_list`; for other terminals, you see their most recently reported values, which may be slightly behind.

Each terminal reports its current working directory on connect. `link_list` shows the full absolute path.

Each terminal also reports its LLM context usage, rendered as `45K/272K (17%)` — tokens used over the context window, with percent. Briefly after compaction it shows as `?/272K` until the next measured context value is available.

Each terminal's status is derived automatically from Pi lifecycle events - agents can't set it manually. Four states:

| Status            | Meaning                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `idle (2m)`       | Waiting for user input                       |
| `thinking (3s)`   | LLM is generating                            |
| `tool:bash (12s)` | The first still-active call, not a list      |
| `compacting (8s)` | Manual compaction gate raised; messages held |

Pi can run tools in parallel, and does by default. `tool:<name>` then names the first still-active call Pi reported — one call that really is still running, not a list of every concurrent one. It advances only when that call ends, and stays `tool:<name>` until the last call ends.

`thinking` means work Pi has not settled yet, which is more than an LLM call: an automatic retry, an automatic compaction and a queued continuation all happen after `agent_end` and inside the same run, and the terminal reports `thinking` through all of them until Pi reports the run settled.

Only a manual compaction shows `compacting`. An automatic (threshold or overflow) compaction never shows it — it is not gated, so it reports `thinking` like the rest of the run it belongs to. A manual compaction also runs briefly before the gate rises, and reads as whatever preceded it until it does.

Durations are computed at render time from a `since` timestamp - no timer traffic over the wire. Terminals that just joined with no status data yet render as blank, not fake idle.

Working directories use full absolute paths in tool output. In the TUI (`/link`), paths are shortened to `~/...` when possible to keep the display compact.

**Example output:**

```
Connected terminals:
  • opus@pi-link (you)  idle (12s)  · 45K/272K (17%)
    cwd: C:\Users\andre\.pi
  • gpt@pi-link  thinking (3s)  · ?/272K
    cwd: C:\Users\andre\.pi
  • docs@pi-link  idle (1m)  · 90K/272K (33%)
    cwd: C:\Users\andre\.pi
```

### `link_compact`

Ask another terminal to compact its context window and wait up to 180 seconds for a result. The target may compact successfully, decline, or return an error. After a successful result, the next call can dispatch work to the freshly trimmed worker.

| Parameter      | Type     | Description                                            |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `to`           | `string` | Target terminal name                                   |
| `instructions` | `string` | Optional custom compaction instructions for the target |

- When the target accepts, it runs `ctx.compact()` — the same operation as `/compact`. Success is returned only after the runtime reports that it finished.
- **Success** result: `Compacted "<name>"`. The worker is now idle with a trimmed context, ready for the next dispatch.
- **Busy decline** — the target accepts only when Pi reports its session idle **and** no manual compaction holds its delivery gate; otherwise it declines immediately with `reason: "busy"` and does not interrupt active work. Pi's idle state is the authority, so an active run, an automatic retry, an automatic compaction and a queued continuation all decline, not just a visible turn.
- **Unsupported decline** — a target whose runtime offers no compaction capability declines with `reason: "unsupported"`, and is never asked to compact.
- **Too-small decline** — a target whose session is under the runtime's compaction threshold declines with `Compact on "<target>" not done: Nothing to compact (session too small)`.
- **Already-compacted decline** — a target that has done nothing since its last compaction declines with `Compact on "<target>" not done: Already compacted`. Two compactions back to back require work in between.
- **Self-target rejection** — calling `link_compact` on yourself returns an error pointing at `/compact`.
- **Flat 180-second timeout** — compaction typically takes 5–60s. The timeout bounds the caller's wait only; nothing aborts the target, so a timed-out call may mean the compaction is still running.
- **A cancelled compaction does not reopen delivery by itself** — pi-link cannot observe the cancellation. The target may keep reporting `compacting` and hold messages without notifying the sender until its next agent run, a later successful compaction, or the 180-second backstop.
- **Caller abort** — if the call is aborted before the request is sent, the target does nothing. After the request is sent, aborting only stops the caller from waiting; it does not cancel the target's work.
- Each call targets one terminal; independent calls can run concurrently.
- Any connected terminal can request compaction on another; link participants are cooperating peers.

## Slash Commands

| Command             | Purpose                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/link`             | Show link status (name, role, online count, agent status, context usage, and cwd per terminal)                           |
| `/link-name [name]` | Rename and save as this session's preferred link name. With no argument, adopts the Pi session name. Restored on resume. |
| `/link-connect`     | Connect to Pi Link (works anytime, with or without `--link`)                                                             |
| `/link-disconnect`  | Disconnect from Pi Link and suppress auto-reconnect (overrides `--link`)                                                 |

### Examples

```
> /link
⚡ Link: builder (hub) · 3 online
  builder: idle (12s) · 45K/272K (17%)
    cwd: ~/my-project
  worker-1: thinking (3s) · ?/272K
    cwd: ~/my-project
  worker-2: tool:bash (5s) · 180K/272K (66%)
    cwd: ~/other-project

> /link-name orchestrator
✓ Renamed to "orchestrator"

> /link-name
✓ Renamed to "my-session"

> /link-disconnect
✓ Disconnected from link

> /link-connect
✓ Joined link as "orchestrator" (3 online)
```

With no argument, `/link-name` adopts the Pi session name. `/link-connect` joins an existing hub if one is running; otherwise it starts the hub.

**Name persistence:** `/link-name` saves your preferred name to the session. Resume later and it's restored automatically. If the name is taken, the hub assigns a variant (e.g., `"builder-2"`), but your preferred name stays saved for the next reconnect. See [Name Uniqueness & Persistence](#name-uniqueness--persistence) for details.

See [Configuration](#configuration) for details on `--link`, `/link-connect`, and `/link-disconnect` behavior.

---

## Configuration

Link is **off by default**. Without `--link`, `--link-name`, or `pi-link`, a fresh session is completely silent — no status bar, no connections, no warnings.

**Naming concepts**

- **link name** — identity used on the network (visible in `link_list`, `/link`, and messages).
- **Pi session name** — identity Pi gives the session itself; lives in the session JSONL's latest `session_info` entry.
- **saved link name** — the link name persisted to the session, restored on resume. Set by `/link-name`, `pi-link <name>`, or `pi --link-name <name>`.
- **`--link-name` flag vs `/link-name` command** — same concept (the link name) at different times (startup vs mid-session).

| What you want                        | Use                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Resume/create a named session        | `pi-link <name>`        |
| Stable link identity, normal Pi flow | `pi --link-name <name>` |
| Quick try, random name               | `pi --link`             |
| Already in a session                 | `/link-connect`         |
| Disconnect mid-session               | `/link-disconnect`      |

`pi-link <name>` resumes/creates a session AND sets your link identity in one step. `pi --link-name <name>` sets only the link identity, leaving Pi's normal session selection (latest in cwd, or fresh) untouched.

**Name normalization:** Link names are normalized — leading/trailing whitespace removed and internal whitespace runs collapsed to a single space. `/link-name "build   lead"` saves and shows as `build lead`.

**Name precedence:** `pi --link-name` > `pi-link <name>` > saved `/link-name` > Pi session name > random `t-xxxx`. _(The `pi-link` wrapper itself does not accept `--link-name`; pick one or the other.)_

`/link-connect` and `/link-disconnect` save their intent to the session — resume later and the connection state is restored without needing the flag. Explicit user intent takes precedence over `--link`.

Once connected, terminals discover each other on `127.0.0.1:9900`. See [Limitations](#limitations--design-decisions) for the hardcoded port.

### Session Resume

Pi's `--session` flag requires a file path, not a display name. `pi-link` bridges this — it resolves a session by name and launches Pi directly:

```bash
pi-link worker-1                # resume or create session "worker-1"
pi-link worker-1 --model sonnet # with extra Pi flags
```

How it works: `pi-link worker-1` scans Pi's session directory, finds the session named "worker-1", and spawns `pi --session <path> --link`. Session-dir resolution matches Pi's lookup order: `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` env > `<cwd>/.pi/settings.json` `sessionDir` > `<agentDir>/settings.json` `sessionDir` > default `<agentDir>/sessions/`. `<agentDir>` follows `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` and defaults to `~/.pi/agent/`.

Lookup is **scoped to the current cwd by default**; pass `--global` (`-g`) to consider sessions in any cwd. A scoped lookup stops reading a session file as soon as its header names another cwd, so it never learns the names of sessions belonging to other directories, and its cost tracks this cwd's own history rather than the history of unrelated projects.

- **One match in scope** → resumes that session
- **No match in scope** → creates a new session in the current cwd, and advises `--global` without claiming a session exists elsewhere.
- **Multiple matches in scope** → prints candidates to stderr, exits 1
- **Conflicting flags** (`--session`, `--continue`, `--resume`, `--fork`, etc.) → rejected with an error

### Discovering sessions

`pi-link --list` shows pi-link sessions in the current cwd; `pi-link --list --global` (or `-g`) lists them across all directories. Sorted by last activity — starting a session with the same name it already has does not bump recency; only real activity (messages, tool calls, edits, name changes) does.

```
$ pi-link --list
NAME             MODIFIED  MESSAGES  ID
opus@pi-link     2m ago    4632      6332faab
gpt@pi-link      5m ago    1493      20d43841

Resume: pi-link <name>
```

With `--global`:

```
$ pi-link --list --global
NAME             CWD                   MODIFIED  MESSAGES  ID
opus@pi-link     ~/my-project          2m ago    4632      6332faab
gpt@pi-link      ~/other-project       5m ago    1493      20d43841

Resume: pi-link <name>
```

`--global` adds a `CWD` column with `~` substituted for `$HOME`. Output is plain when piped (`NO_COLOR` honored).

`pi-link <name>` and `pi-link --resolve <name>` follow the same scoping: local cwd by default, `--global` (or `-g`) widens. A local miss never silently jumps cwds: it says the name was not found here and suggests `--global`. Because a local scan skips sessions from other cwds without reading them, that suggestion is advice rather than a report that a match exists elsewhere - run it with `--global` to find out.

For scripting, `pi-link --resolve <name>` prints just the session path (machine-readable, no other output). Exit codes: `0` on single match, `1` if ambiguous (multiple matches printed to stderr), `2` if not found.

### Who is connected right now

`--list` and `--status` answer different questions. `--list` reads session files on disk and answers *which sessions exist in history on this machine* — a session that died days ago still appears. `--status` asks the running hub and answers *who is connected to the link at this instant* — it is held in the hub's memory, so it needs a live hub and reports nothing about sessions that are merely saved.

```
$ pi-link --status
NAME          STATUS               CONTEXT          CWD
opus@pi-link  idle (7m)            92K/272K (34%)   ~/my-project
gpt@pi-link   tool:link_send (3s)  ?/272K           ~/my-project
new@pi-link   ?                    ?                ?
sol@pi-link   compacting (12s)     1.3M/2.0M (63%)  ~/other-project
```

The hub is listed first, then clients sorted by name. A `?` means the hub could not report that field — for `new@pi-link` above, it has registered but has not yet sent its first status update. **`?` means unknown, not idle.** Reading it as idle is the mistake this command exists to prevent.

The word for what this proves is **connected**, not alive: it shows terminals registered with the hub that answered. A terminal whose process is wedged still holds its connection, so `--status` never claims a terminal is healthy — only that it is on the link.

Querying is read-only. It does not register a terminal, does not appear in anyone's `link_list`, and broadcasts nothing to the fleet.

#### Scripting

`--status --json` writes the hub's response body to stdout verbatim, and the endpoint is plain HTTP, so `curl` works too:

```bash
pi-link --status --json
curl 127.0.0.1:9900/status
```

Two of the terminals above, as the hub reports them:

```json
{
  "hub": "opus@pi-link",
  "port": 9900,
  "terminals": [
    {
      "name": "opus@pi-link",
      "role": "hub",
      "status": "idle",
      "sinceSeconds": 420,
      "cwd": "C:/Users/andre/my-project",
      "context": { "tokens": 92000, "window": 272000 }
    },
    {
      "name": "new@pi-link",
      "role": "client",
      "context": null
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `hub` | Name of the hub that answered; always equal to `terminals[0].name` |
| `port` | Port the hub is bound to |
| `terminals` | Hub first, then clients sorted by name — never empty |
| `terminals[].name` | Terminal name as the hub knows it |
| `terminals[].role` | `hub` for the first entry, `client` for the rest |
| `terminals[].status` | `idle`, `thinking`, `compacting`, or `tool:<name>` |
| `terminals[].sinceSeconds` | Whole seconds in that status, rounded — relative, so no clock agreement is needed |
| `terminals[].cwd` | Working directory; **omitted** when the hub does not know it |
| `terminals[].context` | **Always present**: `null` when there is no snapshot, otherwise `{ tokens, window }` |

**`status` and `sinceSeconds` are one optional pair — both present or both absent.** They are absent for a terminal the hub has registered but not yet heard from. Absence means unknown; do not substitute a default.

**`context` uses `null`, not omission.** The field is always there; `null` means no snapshot exists, and `{ "tokens": null, "window": 272000 }` means a snapshot exists but the token count is mid-refresh (rendered `?/272K`).

Two things may grow, and consumers must tolerate both:

- **Unknown fields.** Documented fields are frozen; new ones may be added, so ignore what you do not recognize rather than rejecting the payload.
- **Unknown `status` values.** The vocabulary is not frozen — it has grown before, gaining `compacting` in 0.3.0. Treat any non-empty string as possible; the CLI renders an unrecognized value as-is instead of refusing the response.

#### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning | Message |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | The hub answered with a valid payload | — |
| `2` | No hub answered | `No link hub running on :9900.` |
| `1` | Usage error, or something answered that is not a compatible hub | `Link hub does not support /status — update pi-link and restart terminals.` |

The two failure messages are deliberately distinct, so a script can tell *the link is down* from *this machine needs upgrading* without parsing anything else. Exit `2` covers both nothing listening and a listener that accepts the request but does not answer within two seconds — every timeout is exit `2`. Exit `1` covers a listener that responds but is not a hub speaking this contract: a pi-link 0.3.0 hub answers plain HTTP with `426 Upgrade Required`, so an out-of-date fleet lands here deterministically rather than looking like an outage.

Exit `2` means no hub answered **at that instant**. When a hub exits, a surviving client promotes itself to replace it, which takes roughly 2–5 seconds — poll again before concluding the fleet is down.

#### Notes

`PI_LINK_PORT` changes only where the CLI looks; the extension always binds the hub to `9900`. It exists so tests can run a stub hub on a free port. The value is not validated — an unusable one simply fails the request and is reported back to you in the exit-`2` message.

The endpoint is bound to `127.0.0.1` with no authentication, the same trust boundary as the WebSocket surface it shares a port with: any process on this machine can already connect to the link.

Finally, `--status` and `--json` belong to the wrapper only until a session name appears. After one, they are pi's: `pi-link mybot --status` forwards `--status` to pi untouched, exactly like any other passthrough flag.

## Architecture

### Hub-Spoke Topology

The network topology is **hub-spoke (star)**:

```
                       +-----------+
                       |    Hub    |

```

- The **first terminal** to start becomes the **hub** - it runs a `WebSocketServer` on `127.0.0.1:9900`.
- **Subsequent terminals** connect as **clients** via plain WebSocket.
- All messages route **through the hub**; clients never talk directly to each other.

### Auto-Discovery Protocol

The discovery sequence runs on startup (with `--link` or `pi-link`) or when `/link-connect` is used. See [Configuration](#configuration) for details.

The sequence is a simple fallback:

1. Attempt to connect as a **client** to `127.0.0.1:9900`. The WebSocket opening handshake is bounded at **5 seconds**; a listener that accepts the connection but never completes the upgrade fails the attempt instead of holding it open.
2. If connection fails → become the **hub** (start a WebSocket server on that port).
3. If both fail (rare race condition) → retry after a randomized 2-5 second backoff.

Only **one attempt runs at a time**, across both steps. Startup, a retry and `/link-connect` arriving while an attempt is in flight all join that attempt rather than opening a second connection, so a terminal cannot register twice or leave a second socket behind.

### Hub Promotion

When the hub disconnects, clients detect the WebSocket close event, enter `"disconnected"` state, and call `scheduleReconnect()`. The **first terminal to retry** becomes the new hub via the same initialize-or-fallback flow.

There is **no explicit leader election** - promotion is race-based.

## Troubleshooting

### Port 9900 is already in use

If another process occupies port 9900, the terminal can't become the hub. It tries to connect as a client first, and that attempt fails within 5 seconds even against a listener that accepts the connection and never speaks WebSocket - so the terminal falls back to trying the hub role and then retries after 2-5 seconds, rather than sitting offline indefinitely. Free the port or modify `DEFAULT_PORT` in `index.ts` - see [Limitations](#limitations--design-decisions).

### `link_compact` reports a busy target

A `link_compact` request does not interrupt work the target is still doing, so it declines while that terminal is unsettled — see [`link_compact`](#link_compact) for the full list of what counts. Try again once `/link` or `link_list` reports the target idle, keeping in mind that idle is what was true a moment ago, not a reservation: the target can start working again before your request lands. `link_send` is different — it enters or steers the target's reasoning instead of declining just because it is busy.

### I sent a message but got no reply

A successful send is not a confirmation. On a client it means the message was handed to the hub connection, not that the target received it or acted on it — and replies are ordinary messages the other agent chooses to send, so nothing produces one automatically. Run `/link`, or ask your model to call `link_list`, and check the target: confirm the name is still exactly right, and note that a target in the `compacting` state holds messages that reach it until that state clears. Otherwise silence may mean the work is still running or that no reply was sent.

### `pi-link --status` reports no hub, or an unsupported one

The two messages mean different things. `No link hub running on :9900.` (exit `2`) means nothing answered — either the link is genuinely down, or you caught it during the 2–5 second window while a client promotes itself to hub, so poll again before believing it. `Link hub does not support /status — update pi-link and restart terminals.` (exit `1`) means something did answer but is not a hub speaking this contract — usually a pi-link 0.3.0 hub, which predates the endpoint. Updating is not enough on its own: the running terminals keep the old hub alive until they restart. See [Who is connected right now](#who-is-connected-right-now).

### Terminals don't see each other

- Verify both terminals are on the same machine (the link only works on `127.0.0.1`).
- Run `/link` in each terminal to check status.
- Ensure port 9900 isn't blocked or occupied by a non-link process.

### Hub promotion loses state

When the hub goes down and a client promotes itself, terminal names and in-flight messages from the old hub session may be lost. All surviving clients reconnect and re-register. This is by design - see [Limitations](#limitations--design-decisions).

## Limitations & Design Decisions

| #   | Decision                                  | Rationale / Impact                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **No authentication**                     | Any localhost process can connect to port 9900. Acceptable for local dev; don't expose the port externally.                                                                                                      |
| 2   | **Hardcoded port (9900)**                 | Not configurable without editing `DEFAULT_PORT` in `index.ts`. Could conflict with other services on the same port.                                                                                              |
| 3   | **Race-based hub promotion**              | Non-deterministic. Terminal names and in-flight ephemeral messages can be lost during promotion. Simple but imperfect.                                                                                           |
| 4   | **No offline backlog**                    | A definitely absent target is rejected, and nothing is stored for later delivery. A terminal that reconnects receives no messages it missed while offline.                                                       |
| 5   | **Client rename triggers full reconnect** | Changing a client's name requires a new `register` message, so the client disconnects and reconnects. Hub renames are handled in-place.                                                                          |
| 6   | **Single-machine / localhost-only**       | Link only binds to `127.0.0.1`; terminals on different machines cannot join.                                                                                                                                     |
| 7   | **Callbacks are conventional**            | Async work results are uncorrelated messages, not protocol responses. A send carries no request identifier, nothing correlates a reply to it, and a callback exists only because the receiver chose to send one. |

## Internals

### Protocol

The wire protocol consists of the following message types, all serialized as JSON over WebSocket frames. Cwd and context fields are optional.

| Type               | Direction       | Purpose                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `register`         | Client → Hub    | First message after connecting; requests a name, optionally reports cwd and context                 |
| `welcome`          | Hub → Client    | Confirms assigned name, terminal list + status/cwd/context snapshots                                |
| `terminal_joined`  | Hub → All       | Broadcast when a terminal joins; may include cwd and context                                        |
| `terminal_left`    | Hub → All       | Broadcast when a terminal disconnects                                                               |
| `chat`             | Any → Any       | Message delivered to the receiver's model: steered into a running agent, or starting a turn if idle |
| `compact_request`  | Any → Any       | Request a remote terminal to compact its context; awaits a response                                 |
| `compact_response` | Any → Any       | Completion/failure response for a compact_request                                                   |
| `status_update`    | Any → Hub → All | Terminal broadcasts agent status change; carries updated context                                    |
| `error`            | Hub → Client    | Error notification                                                                                  |

### Message Flow Examples

**Joining the link:**

```
Client                         Hub
  |                             |
  | register {name:"builder",   |
  |           cwd:"C:\\Users\\..."} |
  |---------------------------->|
  |                             |
  | welcome {name, terminals,   |
  | statuses, cwds}             |
  |<----------------------------|
  |                             |
```

Hub then broadcasts `terminal_joined` to the other connected terminals. The `welcome` message includes status, cwd, and context snapshots for all connected terminals (fields omitted above for brevity). `terminal_joined` also includes the new terminal's optional cwd and context.

**Sending a chat message:**

```
Client A            Hub              Client B
  |                  |                  |
  | chat {to:pi-2}   |                  |
  |----------------->|                  |
  |                  | chat {from:A}    |
  |                  |----------------->|
  |                  |                  |
```

### Name Uniqueness & Persistence

The hub enforces unique terminal names via a `uniqueName()` function. If `"builder"` is already taken, the next terminal requesting that name is assigned `"builder-2"`, then `"builder-3"`, and so on.

Default names are random 4-character hex IDs: `t-a1b2`, `t-c3d4`, etc.

**Persistence:** `/link-name` saves the preferred name to the session via `pi.appendEntry("link-name", { name })`. On session resume, the saved name is restored and requested from the hub. Startup naming (`pi-link <name>`, `pi --link-name <name>`) persists the same way - hub-assigned variants like `"builder-2"` are not saved. On reconnect, the terminal always requests the preferred name, not the last runtime name.

**Rename guards:**

- If you're already using the requested name, `/link-name` returns early (`"Already using..."`).
- On the hub, renaming checks if the name is taken by another connected client before accepting the change.
- On a client, the rename triggers a reconnect; the hub enforces uniqueness during re-registration and may assign a different name if taken.

**Unregistered client guard:** The hub ignores all non-`register` messages from clients that haven't completed registration, preventing protocol violations from malformed or out-of-order messages.

### State Management

| State Field               | Type                                  | Purpose                                                                                                                     |

| `agentRunning`            | `boolean`                             | Between `agent_start` and `agent_settled` — not `agent_end`; drives status only                                             |

| `stateSince`              | `number`                              | Timestamp of last status change (used for duration display)                                                                 |

### Message Routing & Error Handling

`routeMessage()` returns a `boolean` indicating delivery status:

- **Hub** - delivery is authoritative. If a chat target is not connected, the hub sends a protocol-level error back to a client sender; a local hub sender already receives the failed delivery result. A `compact_request` to an unknown target gets a synthesized `compact_response` (`ok: false`, `reason: "not_found"`), so the bounded compact call fails fast.
- **Client** - delivery is optimistic (`true` means "sent to hub"). The hub handles routing and errors via the protocol.

### Connection Lifecycle

Internally, teardown is split into two functions:

- **`disconnect()`** - closes sockets, clears connection state, resolves pending promises. Used by `/link-disconnect` and called internally by `cleanup()`.
- **`cleanup()`** - calls `disconnect()`, sets `disposed = true`, clears `ctx`. Used on `session_shutdown`.

Three helpers protect WebSocket callbacks from stale extension context:

- **`getUi()`** - safely accesses `ctx.ui`, returns `null` if the context is invalidated.
- **`notify()`** - wraps `getUi()?.notify()` for safe notification delivery.
- **`isRuntimeLive()`** - returns `false` if `disposed` or context is stale; checked before processing any incoming WebSocket message.

Startup connect is deferred via `scheduleStartupConnect()` (`setTimeout(0)`) so Pi's startup cycle completes and the extension context is fully valid before WebSocket work begins.

`disconnect()` also cancels the connection attempt in flight: it invalidates the attempt first, then closes whatever it had pending - a dialing socket or a binding server - so nothing can finish establishing after the user asked to disconnect. The startup and retry timers are cancelled on the same path, so `/link-disconnect` before the deferred startup connect opens nothing at all. Because ownership is tracked per attempt, a callback from a superseded or cancelled transport is inert: only the established socket (`ws`) may deliver messages or tear down client state, and only the established server (`wss`) may accept clients.

The `manuallyDisconnected` flag distinguishes user-initiated disconnects (`/link-disconnect`) from connection loss. When set, `scheduleReconnect()` is suppressed - the terminal stays offline until `/link-connect` is explicitly called.

### Agent Lifecycle Integration

The extension hooks into Pi's agent lifecycle events:

- **`agent_start`** → Sets `agentRunning = true`, which drives status. Clears the local compaction gate - safe only under the current deployment, not by Pi alone: Pi refuses to start an ordinary prompt during a manual compaction, and pi-link holds back the one delivery path that refusal does not cover, so nothing can start a run mid-compaction. Another extension starting a turn during one would void that. Also drops any tool calls left recorded; status normally becomes `thinking`.
- **`agent_end`** → Drops any tool calls still recorded, so an unmatched one falls back to `thinking` instead of staying pinned. It deliberately does **not** end the run: Pi may still retry, compact automatically, or drain a queued continuation, so the status stays `thinking`.
- **`agent_settled`** → The authoritative end of a run: Pi emits it once no retry, compaction or queued continuation is left. Status becomes `idle` — unless the event's context reports Pi busy again, which means another extension started a new run during settlement, and that newer run keeps reporting `thinking`.
- **`tool_execution_start`** → Records that call. It is displayed unless an earlier call is still running.
- **`tool_execution_end`** → Drops that one call. The display stays `tool:<name>` while other calls remain, moves to the next call when the displayed one ends, and returns to `thinking` after the last one while the agent run continues.
- **`session_before_compact`** → For a manual compaction, raises the gate that holds inbox delivery. Automatic (threshold/overflow) compaction is left alone: it runs inside the agent run, where Pi already queues and drains steered messages itself.
- **`session_compact`** → Clears the local compaction gate and force-pushes a `status_update` so peers see the new (post-compaction) context usage immediately.
- **`session_shutdown`** → Full cleanup via `cleanup()`: closes all sockets, resolves pending promises, and disposes the extension.

The five agent and tool handlers — `agent_start`, `agent_end`, `agent_settled`, `tool_execution_start`, `tool_execution_end` — each recompute the status and hand it to `pushStatus()`, which publishes only when the status identity differs from the stored baseline of the last published identity. While a baseline is stored, a mutation leaving the display identical is therefore silent: a second tool starting behind the one already shown publishes nothing, and because a raised compaction gate outranks every other state, mutations beneath it publish nothing either. `disconnect()` clears that baseline. Once connected again, whichever comes first restores it: a forced push, such as the one a client makes on `welcome`, or the first of these handler events. So a handler event republishes an unchanged identity only when no forced push got there first — the case for a promoted hub, which receives no `welcome` of its own. The three session handlers are governed by their own bullets above, including `session_compact`'s forced push, which goes out whether the identity changed or not.

Status updates are push-based: each terminal broadcasts changes to the hub, which fans them out. New joiners receive a status snapshot for all terminals in the `welcome` message. Context updates reuse the same status path, including a forced post-compaction update.

### Inbox

An arriving `chat` message goes into a local inbox rather than calling `pi.sendMessage()` immediately, so that arrivals close together can be coalesced into a single delivery.

The flush pipeline:

1. **Fixed window** - `scheduleFlush(FLUSH_DELAY_MS)` arms a timer only when none is pending, so the first queued message sets the deadline (about 200ms) and later arrivals join that window without moving it. The window is not sliding: sustained arrivals closer together than the delay cannot postpone delivery.
2. **Compaction gate** - `flushInbox()` returns without rescheduling while the compaction gate is raised.
3. **Batch** - up to 20 messages or ~16 000 chars per delivery (soft cap - the first item is always included even if oversized).
4. **Deliver** - one `pi.sendMessage()` call with a `[Link: N message(s) received]` block. Pi reads the receiver's state at this point — not at send time — to decide whether the batch steers a running agent or starts a turn.
5. **Drain** - if the inbox still has items, reschedule.

Delivery is held while a `manual`-reason compaction holds this terminal's gate, because a message delivered mid-compaction would be reasoned about against context that is being rebuilt. Two flags gate it: `compactRunning` for a compaction serving a remote `link_compact`, and `localCompacting`, set from `session_before_compact`. A human `/compact` aborts and prepares before Pi emits that event, so the gate rises a moment after the compaction starts; a flush in that gap can still start a turn, and the message itself survives. A remote request raises both, since Pi reports its own reason as `manual` either way. Automatic (threshold/overflow) compaction is deliberately **not** gated: it runs inside the agent run, where Pi already queues steered messages and drains them afterwards.

Because a gated flush does not reschedule, the release path is load-bearing. `releaseInbox()` is called after either flag clears and schedules a flush only when neither gate remains — so a remote compaction's `session_compact` calls it and correctly does nothing, and the later `finish()` is what drains. `compactDeadline` is the backstop, since a failed compaction reports no ending to an extension at all.

| Constant             | Value   | Purpose                                          |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `FLUSH_DELAY_MS`     | 200     | Batching window, from the first queued message   |
| `BATCH_MAX_ITEMS`    | 20      | Max messages per batch                           |
| `BATCH_MAX_CHARS`    | 16 000  | Soft cap on batch text size (~4K tokens)         |
| `COMPACT_TIMEOUT_MS` | 180 000 | Remote-compact wait, reused as the gate backstop |

### Rendering

Delivered link batches render with a styled `⚡ [link]` prefix using the theme's accent color; sender attribution lives in the `From "name":` blocks inside the message body, not in the prefix. The link status text in Pi's footer uses `theme.fg("dim", ...)` to match Pi's standard footer styling.
